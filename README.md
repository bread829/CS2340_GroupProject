This program plays a magic number game, where the user thinks of a number between 1 and 63 and the computer shows 6 cards and the user inputs Y or N if the number is present.

The program features:
- An optional bitmap display
- Sound when the input is invalid/valid, in addition fanfare and drumroll at the end
- User input validation, and dealing with the event that the User inputs 'N' for all cards
